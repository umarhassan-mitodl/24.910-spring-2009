  "course_description": "This course explores topics related to the representation and expression of propositional attitudes (_e.g._ belief, knowledge, and desires) and speech acts (_e.g._ saying and asking) in natural language. The main focus will be on semantics of predicates such as **believe, know, want, say, ask**, etc. Other topics will include the syntax of main and embedded clauses and formal representation of the pragmatics of conversation. The course provides practice in written and oral communication.\n",
